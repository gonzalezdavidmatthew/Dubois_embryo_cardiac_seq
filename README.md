This is a repository for code related to publication:

Gonzalez DM, Schrode N, Ebrahim T, Broguiere N, Rossi G, Drakhlis L, Zweigerdt R, Lutolf M, Beaumont K, Sebra R, Dubois NC. (2022). Dissecting Mechanisms of Chamber-Specific Cardiac Differentiation and its Perturbation Following Retinoic Acid Exposure. Development (in press). 

The raw data from this project, as well as pre-processed objects can be accessed via the GEO (GSE205950) at the following link: https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.eresources.mssm.edu/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE205950.

Several files are included with this repository including the following: 

1) Gonzalez_Schrode2022_Seurat_Normal_Analysis: Seurat analysis detailing generation of the objects used for analysis in this publication beginning from the .rds objects deposited for each individual sample. This file gives a general analysis strategy that was used for annotation of the invidual populations, how the cardiac regions were subset and integrated together, and gives general examples as to how subclustering individual populations were done.
